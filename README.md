✅ Data Pipeline
MATLAB ➝ Pandas conversion

Preprocessing: merging trust matrices with rating timelines

✅ Feature Engineering
friendshipness (Jaccard index)

interaction_count (pairwise frequency)

Normalized PDR, confidence, and composite total score

✅ Trust Intelligence
mean_trust_given and mean_trust_received per user

Stratified sampling (balanced across PDR, confidence, friendshipness)

✅ Visualizations
Histograms of scores

Activity histograms (trustor/trustee)

Monthly trend timelines

Heatmaps for:

Ballot stuffing

Bad mouthing

✅ Machine Learning
✅ Isolation Forest to detect anomalous trustors (based on total trust patterns)

✅ Color-coded time series plots of anomalous behavior

✅ Attack Simulation
💣 On-Off Attack injection on users with ≥ 200 interactions

🎯 Graphical effect observed post-injection
